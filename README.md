# HEATER Project

## **H**ow **E**mbryos **A**cclimate to **T**emperature through **E**pigenetic **R**egulation

### Project Goal

The aim of this project is to use 10X Genomics Multiome (ATAC + GEX) Single Nuclei Sequencing to understand the way that genes are regulated and expressed in response to warm and cool thermal acclimation during embryonic development in _D. melanogaster_.

### File structure

The files in this project are organized into the following directory structure:

- `data/` 
    - `raw/` - all raw data
    - `processed/` - all processed data
    
- `scratch/` - auxiliary data analysis that is not a part of the final product
  - `calderon/` information and analysis from Calderon _et al._ 2022
    - `nuclei/` info and analysis related to nuclei troubleshooting
        - `flow/` flow cytometry data and analysis
    - `pbmc/` practice pbmc data set
    
- `output/` - all output
    - `figs/` - figures
